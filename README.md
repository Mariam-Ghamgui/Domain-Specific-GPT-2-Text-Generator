# Domain-Specific-GPT-2-Text-Generator

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Gradio

## Overview

This project aims to fine-tune a GPT-2 model on a domain-specific dataset to generate high-quality, context-aware text. The goal is to create a model capable of producing relevant and coherent text for specialized applications, such as technical documentation, domain-specific FAQs, or creative content.

## Key Features  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization and dataset preparation for efficient training.  
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Training GPT-2 with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.  
- **Evaluation:** Performance measured using metrics such as perplexity and BLEU.  
- **Interactive Demo:** Real-time text generation using a Gradio web interface.  
- **Deployment:** Easy-to-run interface for testing and sharing model outputs.

## Status

This repository serves as a placeholder to showcase the project in my CV. Full implementation, including model training scripts and demo, will be added very soon.

## CV Use

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **deep learning, large language models, and NLP deployment**.
